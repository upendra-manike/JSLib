🔗 npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upendra.manike/tiny-utils

## Version 3: Storytelling Format

From idea to npm: 5 libraries that solve real problems 🚀

As a developer, I often found myself writing the same utilities or reaching for bloated libraries. So I decided to build focused, modern alternatives:

📦 **Smart Date** - Because "2 hours ago" is more human than "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
📦 **API Chain** - Because sequential API calls shouldn't be a pain
📦 **Tiny Utils** - Because sometimes you just need chunk() and uniq()
📦 **Lite Fetcher** - Because caching should be built-in, not an afterthought
📦 **React Motion Kit** - Because beautiful animations shouldn't take forever to implement

Each library is:
• Small & focused
• Fully typed (TypeScript)
• Zero dependencies
• Production-tested
• Open source (MIT)

Check them out on npm! Links in comments 👇

Built with ❤️ for the developer community
