🎭 Animations That Don't Hurt: Prebuilt React Hooks for Beautiful UIs

Animations can make or break user experience. Done right, they feel magical. Done wrong, they feel janky, slow, or distracting. But here's the problem: implementing smooth animations takes time, and most developers don't have the luxury to perfect animation curves and timings.

That's why I built @upendra.manike/react-motion-kit - a collection of prebuilt, production-tested animation hooks that work out of the box.

🎨 The Animation Problem

Every React developer faces the animation challenge:

1. **Time-Consuming**: Writing custom animations from scratch
2. **Inconsistent**: Different developers implement differently
3. **Complexity**: Understanding Framer Motion's API takes learning
4. **Repetitive**: Same animations in every project

You find yourself writing the same fade-in, slide-in, or hover effects over and over.

✨ The Solution: Prebuilt Hooks

React Motion Kit provides ready-to-use animation hooks built on Framer Motion:

```typescript
import { useFadeIn, useSlideIn, useBounce } from '@upendra.manike/react-motion-kit';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function MyComponent() {
  const fade = useFadeIn({ duration: 0.5 });
  const slide = useSlideIn({ direction: 'up', distance: 50 });
  
  return (
    <>
      <motion.div {...fade}>Fade in</motion.div>
      <motion.div {...slide}>Slide in</motion.div>
    </>
  );
}
```

That's it. No configuration, no learning curve - just smooth animations.

🎯 Available Animations

**1. Fade In:**
Perfect for page transitions, modal appearances, and content reveals.

```typescript
const fade = useFadeIn({ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.2 });
```

**2. Slide In:**
Great for lists, cards, and staggered content.

```typescript
const slide = useSlideIn({ 
  direction: 'up', // 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right'
  distance: 50 
});
```

**3. Scale:**
Useful for buttons, cards, and interactive elements.

```typescript
const scale = useScale({ from: 0, to: 1 });
```

**4. Bounce:**
Perfect for call-to-action buttons and attention-grabbing elements.

```typescript
const bounce = useBounce({ duration: 0.6 });
```

**5. Shake:**
Great for error states, invalid inputs, and notifications.

```typescript
const shake = useShake({ duration: 0.5 });
```

**6. Pulse:**
Ideal for loading states, attention indicators, and live updates.

```typescript
const pulse = usePulse({ duration: 1.5 });
```

**7. Hover Effects:**
Prebuilt hover and tap animations.

```typescript
const hover = useHover({ scale: 1.1, translateY: -5 });
```

**8. Prebuilt Components:**
Ready-to-use animated components.

```typescript
import { AnimatedButton, AnimatedModal } from '@upendra.manike/react-motion-kit';

<AnimatedButton variant="bounce">Click me!</AnimatedButton>

<AnimatedModal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose} variant="scale">
  <div>Modal content</div>
</AnimatedModal>
```

💡 Real-World Use Cases

**1. Landing Page:**
```typescript
function LandingPage() {
  const fade = useFadeIn();
  const slide = useSlideIn({ direction: 'up' });
  
  return (
    <div>
      <motion.h1 {...fade}>Welcome</motion.h1>
      <motion.p {...slide}>Get started today</motion.p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**2. Dashboard Cards:**
```typescript
function Dashboard() {
  const slide = useSlideIn({ direction: 'up' });
  
  return cards.map((card, index) => (
    <motion.div
      key={card.id}
      {...slide}
      transition={{ delay: index * 0.1 }}
    >
      <Card data={card} />
    </motion.div>
  ));
}
```

**3. Form Validation:**
```typescript
function FormInput({ error }) {
  const shake = useShake();
  
  return (
    <motion.input
      {...(error ? shake : {})}
      className={error ? 'error' : ''}
    />
  );
}
```

**4. Interactive Buttons:**
```typescript
function CTAButton() {
  const hover = useHover({ scale: 1.1 });
  
  return (
    <motion.button {...hover}>
      Sign Up
    </motion.button>
  );
}
```

🎨 Why Animations Matter

**User Experience:**
• Animations provide visual feedback
• They guide user attention
• They make interfaces feel responsive
• They add polish and professionalism

**Performance:**
• Proper animations use GPU acceleration
• They feel smooth at 60fps
• They don't block the main thread

**Accessibility:**
• Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
• Provide meaningful transitions
• Don't overdo it

📊 Performance Considerations

React Motion Kit is built on Framer Motion, which:

• Uses hardware acceleration
• Optimizes animation performance
• Respects browser capabilities
• Provides smooth 60fps animations

Each hook is optimized and production-tested. You get professional animations without performance penalties.

🔧 Customization

While the defaults work great, you can customize everything:

```typescript
// Custom fade in
const fade = useFadeIn({
  duration: 0.8,
  delay: 0.3,
  ease: 'easeOut'
});

// Custom slide
const slide = useSlideIn({
  direction: 'left',
  distance: 100,
  duration: 0.6
});

// Custom hover
const hover = useHover({
  scale: 1.15,
  rotate: 5,
  translateY: -8,
  duration: 0.3
});
```

🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install @upendra.manike/react-motion-kit framer-motion
```

```typescript
import { useFadeIn } from '@upendra.manike/react-motion-kit';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function App() {
  const fade = useFadeIn();
  
  return (
    <motion.div {...fade}>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

Requires: React 16.8+ and Framer Motion 10+

💡 Best Practices

1. **Don't Overdo It**: Use animations purposefully, not everywhere
2. **Respect Preferences**: Check `prefers-reduced-motion`
3. **Keep It Fast**: Animations should be under 500ms typically
4. **Be Consistent**: Use the same animation patterns across your app
5. **Test Performance**: Profile animations on slower devices

🎯 When to Use React Motion Kit

**Perfect for:**
✅ Landing pages and marketing sites
✅ Dashboards and data visualizations
✅ Interactive UIs
✅ Prototyping and MVPs
✅ Any project needing smooth animations

**Consider alternatives when:**
• You need complex, custom animation sequences
• You're building animation-heavy games
• You need server-side rendering of animations
