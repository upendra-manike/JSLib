# GitHub Repository Status

## Current Status

❌ **Repository NOT created yet** on GitHub

The local Git repository is set up with remote pointing to:
- `https://github.com/upendrakumarmanike/JSLib.git`

But the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet (404 error).

## Options

You can create it as either:

### 🔓 Public Repository (Recommended for npm packages)
- ✅ Anyone can see and use your code
- ✅ Better for open-source packages
- ✅ Shows up in GitHub search
- ✅ Can get stars and contributions
- ✅ Good for portfolio/showcase

### 🔒 Private Repository
- ✅ Only you (and collaborators) can see
- ✅ Good if you want to keep code private
- ⚠️ Less discoverable
- ⚠️ Not ideal for open-source npm packages

## Recommendation

Since all 15 packages are **already published to npm as public packages**, I recommend creating a **PUBLIC** repository because:

1. Open-source packages are typically in public repos
2. Transparency builds trust
3. Easier for others to contribute
4. Shows your work in your GitHub profile

## How to Create the Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: **JSLib**
3. Description: "A collection of 15 modern, production-ready JavaScript/TypeScript libraries"
4. Select **Public** (recommended) or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (README, .gitignore, license)
6. Click **"Create repository"**
7. Then push your code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**After creating the repository, run:**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
